<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 1</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Andre Sardino Arno - 13259907, Stephen Anthony Chandra - 13251860, Tshering Namgyay Wangchuck - 13257283, Constant Hughes-Treherne - 13340384</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p> Fish-Tastic is a business that primarily focuses on the sale of fish and aquatic supplies, also offering events and classes on development in skills related to aqautic structures. Fish-Tastic has decided to venture into more than just the sales of fish and equipment. A new section will be introduced into the development of a pet shop, focusing on sales of puppies, and offering veterinary services. In order to succesfully implement the upcoming additions it will have to be communicated to the exisiting customers, and possibly future customers. Fish-Tastic is focusing on expanding their already established brand, and attract more customers, expanding their speciality by having the annoucement present on the new and redesigned website, which is a prime communication medium. A simplistic design is promonent and will allow for easy navigation, and not discourage the user.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> In order to ensure that the website is optimal and that it meets the requirements, certain factors will determine popularity and if the focused function is executed properly. The website will feature a sales mechanism, data can be collected and see the amount of orders placed, determining if it is a viable feature. Fish-Tastic offers specific products and services to a niche market. If the ratio between visitors and customers is favourable then the sales portion of the website will be beneficial. Along with this function events will be introduced with classes additionaly, if executed correctly customers will be able to easily identify this and interact with it, the greater the number of attendees, the greater the success of this feature.  </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Previously the target audience included those whom share interest in the maintenace and keeping of fish, be it fresh or salt water fish. More specificly this would appeal to people who want to take on the responsibility of having a pet, and the challenge of maintaining the aquarium. Fish enthausists are mainly the target audience before the expasion, and possibly children who want their first pet. With the expansion to offering veterinary services and the sale of puppies, Fish-Tastic will attract a target audience who want's dogs, and would like to bring their dogs for check-ups and other procedures. Fish-Tastic will then cater to another audience being people who have a interest in dogs, and other animals that need the veterinary service.</p>

    <p> <h2>Salt Water</h2> 
    </p>
    	<p><strong> Regel Tang($30)</strong> - The Blue Tang is also known as the Regal Tang, Blue Surgeonfish, and Indo-Pacific Blue Tang. This gorgeous fish is readily available, easy to keep, and is very interesting to watch. We knew of one that would spend time everyday in play, chasing bubbles from the bottom of the aquarium to the top!
Readily available and very beautiful, the Blue Tang is probably the second most popular tang next to the Yellow tang!
Maintenance difficulty:
   The Blue Tang, Regal Tang, Blue Surgeonfish, or Indo-Pacific Blue Tang is easy to keep.
Maintenance:
   It is important that you feed tangs a good variety of live, frozen, and prepared formula foods. The Blue Tang eats zooplankton so they should be fed brine shrimp, mysis, grindal worms, and flake food. It is best to feed small amounts several times a day.
Habitat: Natural geographic location:
   Blue Tang, Regal Tang, Blue Surgeonfish, or Indo-Pacific Blue Tang are found in the Indo-Pacific from East Africa to Japan. Swims at depths of 10 to 40 meters.
Foods:
   In the sea they eat mainly zooplankton.
Minimum Tank Length/Size:
   A minimum 75 gallon aquarium is recommended for an adult.

<p><strong>Chocolate Tang($57-$72)</strong>
Mimic Tang ~ Mimic Surgeonfish ~ Chocolate Surgeonfish
Family: Acanthuridae
Most often the Chocolate Tang or Mimic Tang is available as a juvenile, and depending upon where it was collected, will look very much like the dwarf angelfish also living in that location. As this tang gets older it changes into its very pretty adult coloration shown in the picture above.
   The Chocolate Tang or Mimic Tang is a good choice for the home aquarium. They go through an interesting color change from juvenile to adult and are favored because they don't get as large as many others in the same genus. They are moderately easy to care for as long as they are provided with a good environment and their nutritional needs are met.
Maintenance:
   A quick and agile swimmer it will spend a good deal of its time in the open water and moving in and out of crevices. Frequent water changes are not necessary, rather normal water changes at 10% biweekly or 20% monthly are fine.
Maintenance difficulty:
   The relatively small size of the Chocolate Tang lends itself to being a great addition to the marine aquarium. It is easy to acclimate and keep if you purchase a juvenile, adults are reportedly very hard to acclimate. Once it is use to its environment it is quite hardy, adaptable to a wide variety of foods, and can handle a wide range of water parameters. However it will do best in an environment that provides consistency, not only in water conditions and quality, but also in decor and fellow inhabitants. It can be housed in a fish only tank or in a reef environment as it will not harm corals or invertebrates.
Habitat: Natural geographic location:
As adults they are generally found singly inhabiting shallow lagoons and coastal reef slopes and crests, enjoying areas with corals, rock and sand at the base of reefs. They are found at depths between 13 to 196 feet (4 - 60 meters).
Foods:
   The Chocolate Tang or Mimic Tang are primarily herbivores. In the wild they graze on benthic algae. In the aquarium the majority of their intake will be vegetable matter, but they do need some meaty foods as well. Provide lots of algae, prepared frozen formulas containing algae or spirulina, frozen brine and mysis shrimp, and flake foods. Japanese Nori or other seaweed can be adhered to the aquarium glass with a vegetable clip. An occasional live rock with micro and macro organisms will be greatly appreciated. Culturing macro algae like chaetomorphia in the tank is also a great idea. Feed at least three times a day.
Aquarium Parameters:
All surgeonfish/ tangs are quick agile swimmers and need lots of open areas. To feel secure they also need rocks/ corals with many nooks and crannies to hide in and to wedge themselves into at night for sleeping. This fish will not bother corals or inverts but it will graze on algae, so it highly useful in a reef environment.
Minimum Tank Length/Size:
   A minimum 75 gallon (284 liters).

<p> <strong> Doctorfish($5-$10) </strong>
Black Doctorfish ~ Doctor
Family: Acanthuridae
One of the hardier surgeonfish, the Doctorfish is a good choice for the home aquarium. It is easy to care for as long as it is provided with a good environment and its nutritional needs are met. The main concern for this fish is a large tank so it can feel comfortable.
Length/Diameter of fish:
   According to Fishbase adults reach 15.4 inches (39 cm).
Maintenance:
   A quick and agile swimmer it will spend a good deal of its time in the open water and moving in and out of crevices. Frequent water changes are not necessary, rather normal water changes at 10% biweekly or 20% monthly are fine.
Maintenance difficulty:
   This Doctorfish is easy to care for as long as it has an adequate environment and its nutritional needs are met. The main concern for this fish is a large tank so it can feel comfortable. It can be kept in a fish only tank as long as there is plenty of swimming room and some rocks/ corals with nooks and crannies to hide in. It is quite hardy, fairly disease resistant, and can handle a wide range of water parameters. However it will do best in an environment that provides consistency, not only in water conditions and quality, but also in decor and fellow inhabitants.
Habitat: Natural geographic location:
They are found at depths between 6.5 to 82 feet (2 - 25 meters). In their natural habitat they live singly, in pairs, or in loose groupings eating algae and detritus in rocky areas, inshore seagrass beds, or in shallow reefs. They sometimes travel with schools of the Ocean Surgeon A. bahianus.
Food
In the aquarium they will eat algae, pieces of fish, mussel meat, flakes, tablets, and a variety of other foods. Provide prepared frozen marine formulas including those containing marine algae or spirulina, frozen brine and mysid shrimp, flake foods, and tablets. Japanese Nori or other seaweed can also be offered. An occasional live rock with micro and macro organisms will be greatly appreciated. Culturing macro algae like chaetomorphia in the tank is also a great idea.   Feed 2 to 3 times a day in smaller amounts instead of a large quantity once a day. 
Aquarium Parameters:
All surgeonfish/ tangs are quick agile swimmers and need lots of open areas. To feel secure they also need rocks/ corals with many nooks and crannies to hide in and to wedge themselves into at night for sleeping. As this fish will not bother corals but it will graze on algae. It is highly useful in a reef environment as long as their are no invertebrates as it may snack on them.
Minimum Tank Length/Size:
   A minimum 125 gallon (473 liters). If attempting more than one of this genus, a tank with hundreds of gallons is needed as they are territorial.
