<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 1</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>Andre Sardino Arno - 13259907, Stephen Anthony Chandra - 13251860, Tshering Namgyay Wangchuck - 13257283, Constant Hughes-Treherne - 13340384</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p> Fish-Tastic is a business that primarily focuses on the sale of fish and aquatic supplies, also offering events and classes on development in skills related to aqautic structures. Fish-Tastic has decided to venture into more than just the sales of fish and equipment. A new section will be introduced into the development of a pet shop, focusing on sales of puppies, and offering veterinary services. In order to succesfully implement the upcoming additions it will have to be communicated to the exisiting customers, and possibly future customers. Fish-Tastic is focusing on expanding their already established brand, and attract more customers, expanding their speciality by having the annoucement present on the new and redesigned website, which is a prime communication medium. A simplistic design is promonent and will allow for easy navigation, and not discourage the user.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> In order to ensure that the website is optimal and that it meets the requirements, certain factors will determine popularity and if the focused function is executed properly. The website will feature a sales mechanism, data can be collected and see the amount of orders placed, determining if it is a viable feature. Fish-Tastic offers specific products and services to a niche market. If the ratio between visitors and customers is favourable then the sales portion of the website will be beneficial. Along with this function events will be introduced with classes additionaly, if executed correctly customers will be able to easily identify this and interact with it, the greater the number of attendees, the greater the success of this feature.  </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Previously the target audience included those whom share interest in the maintenace and keeping of fish, be it fresh or salt water fish. More specificly this would appeal to people who want to take on the responsibility of having a pet, and the challenge of maintaining the aquarium. Fish enthausists are mainly the target audience before the expasion, and possibly children who want their first pet. With the expansion to offering veterinary services and the sale of puppies, Fish-Tastic will attract a target audience who want's dogs, and would like to bring their dogs for check-ups and other procedures. Fish-Tastic will then cater to another audience being people who have a interest in dogs, and other animals that need the veterinary service.</p>
