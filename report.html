<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Fish-Tastic is a business that primarily focuses on the sale of fish and aquatic supplies, also offering events and classes on development in skills related to aqautic structures. Fish-Tastic has decided to venture into more than just the sales of fish and equipment. A new section will be introduced into the development of a pet shop, focusing on sales of puppies, and offering veterinary services. In order to succesfully implement the upcoming additions it will have to be communicated to the exisiting customers, and possibly future customers. Fish-Tastic is focusing on expanding their already established brand, and attract more customers, expanding their speciality by having the annoucement present on the new and redesigned website, which is a prime communication medium. A simplistic design is promonent and will allow for easy navigation, and not discourage the user.</p>
<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<p>brief details of who did what</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Andre Sardino Arno </strong>: Services Page, Events, and Puppy Page. Checked all links for final test before hosting.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>any details required to test the site, including instructions if needed, outstanding issues(like things that look as though they work but don't)</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>One of the issues were linking all the pages correctly and noting down where the error lied.</li><br>
      <li>If the CSS that applied on HTML, works as a template for all of the webpages and there are no codes which overlaps.</li><br>
      <li>The CSS and JQuery are conflicting for first sample of the product page, which the design and layout do not show.</li>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> We leanred to understand what it is like to work in a group and get along well with each other. We managed to split the work fairly between each other, and minimise the work load per person, and not allow them to have a lot of stress.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Time management became an issue early on, we had to all meet a few times in order to discuss the project in depth, especially during the planning phase. However luckily GitHub helped as to work remotely on issues and address them as we went along.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> The main lesson would have been working in a team, and how to execute this well. We managed to understand what it is to spread the work load, and not lwave things until last minute, which will increase stress in the group. We all learned numerous techniques from one another, and helped eachother even though it might not have been our section that we were assigned on.</p>
